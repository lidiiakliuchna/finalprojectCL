      "Enter your essay: \"International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country. On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone. On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes. To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone.\"\n",

      "Enter your essay for feedback or 'quit' to exit: \"Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only. Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty. But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again. Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there. Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.\"\n"

Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only. Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty. But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again. Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there. Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.\"\n",

With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects. It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead. It is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly. In conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society.\"\n",

I completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view. A very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones. Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills. In conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives.\"\n",

Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n",
      "Essay: Some people believe that the science of food and how to make meals should be introduced in schools while others argue that schools should offer only important subjects. I believe that the science of food and how to prepare it should be part of the school subjects as it can bring several benefits in studentÃ¢ÂÂs lives. Thus, this essay discusses how creating an understanding of good nutrition, health and well-being itÃ¢ÂÂs important for students to support positive learning and development.\n",
      "Modern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the studentsÃ¢ÂÂ choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.\n",
      "Contrarily, thereÃ¢ÂÂs the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.\n",
      "To sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to studentsÃ¢ÂÂ learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing.\n",

      "The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level.

Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.\n",
      "However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.\n",

Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life.

For instance, generaly, when we became an adult, we join company to do work at that time. It will increase some oppotunities to relate with woman, commonly. In this case, the person who get used to relating with woman is better advantages for working for negosiations and, to keep better relationships among a company. For this reason, there are the merits as well to go to co-educational schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusions, some people believe that in terms of going to single-sex schools bring some disadvantages than go to co-educational schools though, it is possiblle to deicide by parents. In addition, it is depeds on the child situations but, there are so many advantages to go to co-educational schools as I said.', 'In recent years, advertisements are becoming more and more popular in the marketing of services and products. I think advertisements can have both - positive and negative effects.\\nThe first advantage of advertising is that it can bring a lot of benefits. So, advertisement generates a diversity of employment opportunities. It provides a career for people who prepare the content of advertisements, design logos or brand awareness for companies. Without this marketing sector, we would have higher unemployment in the world. Another advantage of advertising is that it can promote brand, spread awareness of the messages about products and then products should reach potential consumers, it would attract more customers. Also, by advertising, customers could find out about newly launched products. And as a result, people could select from the bigger choice  of products and could know more detailed information about products\\nHowever, advertising also has some disadvantages. First of all, there are some technology companies which are collecting data about costumers such as your browsing history or your emails to electronic companies to guide your behaviour on the Internet for commercial purposes. Secondly, there are some brands which influence consumer psychology and trigger memories of childhood or Christmas. As a result, people feel under pressure to buy those brandsâ\\x80\\x99 products. Lastly, advertisers often focus on selling a brand image rather than the quality of products by using famous and successful people. Then, customers can be manipulated by the misleading, eye-catching image of influence and they will be likely to spend more money and follow the latest trend.\\nIn conclusion, advertisements have some positive effects for customers and marketing companies, but it also has some negative effects for customers such as boost sales (when customers spend more money) or celebrity endorsement (when customers are manipulated).', 'Traditionally, some people hold the belief that spending money on training elite competitors to shine on the international stage in worthwhile. Nowadays, a growing number of people tend to believe that a country should invest more youngstersâ\\x80\\x99 physical conditions, and therefore stimulate their interest for participating sports from an early age.\\nSome people believe that it is not worthwhile to finance sport competitors merely for the purpose of achieving success in the global arena if we take the poor situation of mass sports into consideration. The lack of physical exercise has become a huge problem among citizens, particularly teenagers, as the construction and maintenance of sport facilities is underfunded. Actually, childrenâ\\x80\\x99s sport activities are more beneficial for the future development of a nation as sports can ensure that children maintain enthusiasm for sports and keep good physical condition in the future study so that they deserve more financial support from the government as well as sponsors of sport events.\\nAdmittedly, global sports champions do not only provide audience with the perfect opportunities to enjoy the excellent performance of athletes but also assist host countries a perfect chance to present the success of the event in front of globally political and business leaders who are highly likely to watch live broadcast via satellite sensors. However, squandering money for supporting competitors to enrol worldwide sport competitions seems to bring little actual affect to general public. It is largely because there are only a few top athletes having the chance to win the medals but their routine training demands high-standard facilities which can hardly be used by ordinary people.\\nInclusion, when countries raise fund for sports or celebrate the victory of their athletes, they should not neglect the fact that many children are in great need of sports facilities.\\n', 'A lot of individuals nowadays are required to work shifts. Such people are exposed to a variety of problems such as high levels of stress and criminals who might come during the night shift. A few steps can be taken to solve these issues.\\r\\nShift workers are faced by different problems regardless of their jobs. Firstly, the exhaustion that they face during their working hours is undeniable. Due to not having regular working hours, their bodies cannot adapt to a specific working pattern since they might work in the evenings or at night. As a result, they suffer from the lack of sleep and feel sluggish in the morning and cannot focus on any tasks. Secondly, people who work during the night shift are exposed to the serious problem of facing dangerous people. For instance, a cashier who works at night might face dangerous criminals, thieves, or people who consumed large amounts of alcohol or drugs.\\r\\nThere are some steps that can mitigate or even eliminate the drawbacks of working shifts. Shift workers must take care of themselves during the time they are not working. In other words, they must get at least seven hours of sleep, eat three healthy meals, and take vitamins. This can help their bodies get stronger and avoid malnutrition and fatigue. Furthermore, they should be checked by their doctors regularly since they are likely to develop anxiety and high blood pressure due to high levels of stress. Another point is that supermarkets that are open during the night must install cameras inside and outside the store to threaten criminals. \\r\\nIn conclusion, although shift workers face some problems, they can be reduced if cameras were installed in supermarkets and if employees took care of themselves and maintained their health.', \"These days as the population is increasing at an unprecedented pace, the housing shortage has become one of the main consequences. It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. \\n\\nTo begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. \\n\\nSecondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. \\n\\nTo conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing.\", \"Art has always been the spirit of each culture and the artists are the ones who create this spirit. There are some opposing ideas around providing some assisstance to all kinds of artists. Some people believe that artists must be helped by the authority and the others consider this action as a waste of public budget.  I believe that the government should value the artists and their efforts by supporting them mentally and financially.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people believe that the artists must be supported as they can give a characteristic to a society. A poem can show the history and the culture of a community, A painting and the other types of visual art like photographs can attract more tourists and expand the tourism industry. A lot of countries can find a reputation only by a piece of art. Louvre musuem, as an instance, attract millions of tourists which can be a great aid to support the tourism industry. Not all the people care about art and plargarism and lack of copy right are common crimes in different societies which can truly hurt each artist mentally and financially. It is the governments' responsibility to control and prevent these crimes  from happening and  provide a thorough support for all artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people do not consider art as an essential element in society and believe that public money should be spent on other activities such as scientific researches rather than art. Although science, agriculture and the other fields are really important, the art should be considered as important as them. As it helps people to feel more relaxed and prevent depression. Not only does it give the spirit to the society, but also it can increase the employment rate in each country. We should all be aware that not all the people are interested in science or mathematics and there are people who can perform really well in different art related topics.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that it is really crucial for each government to support the artists in order to motivate them to nourish the culture and literature of the socity.\", 'The provision of funding and building structures to promote adult education should take utmost priority as against the education of younger generation by any Government. This essay tends to discuss the merits and demerits of the government focusing and developing adult education as against the younger generation.\\n\\nEducation is for all ages and should not be limited to the younger generation.  One of the key merits of adult education is that it gives the older generation a sense of belonging in the society. As we are all aware, the society is evolving with advanced technology daily and the only way to keep pace with what is happening in the world today is constant learning. Therefore, a society with more uneducated adults will give room for bad governance, decline growth rate and mismanagement of resources.   \\n\\nIn addition, it is important for the government to provide adequate structures and funding to promote adult education reason being leaders who can neither read nor write but occupy leadership positions, will hinder the economy growth of any country. As a result, adults should be encouraged to keep learning at all cost as it promotes creative thinking and active mind. No country would experience any progressive economy growth if the policy makers, regulators or industry players are not able to make or take decisive actions. \\n\\nWhile educating the younger generation should not be neglected as the saying goes â\\x80\\x9cthey are the leaders of tomorrowâ\\x80\\x9d however, their tomorrow can only be guaranteed where the leaders steering the wheels are constantly learning to be able to preserve the resources of the country for the younger generation.  \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is important that any government who understands that educating adults is key to growth, would provide adequate funding in setting up structures that would supports adult education.', 'Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.\\nFirstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. ThatÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.\\nSecondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.\\nConsequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.', 'Major international events are fascinating. The city host usually has their once in a lifetime experience as being the worldâ\\x80\\x99s spotlight.  On the other hand, several people tend to believe this leads to unreasonable financial expenditure. As far as I concerned, although International games are overpriced, they are satisfactory to a long-term cityâ\\x80\\x99s legacy. This essay will present a discussion of both sides of view. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, when a country wins the bid to host an Olympic Games is the chance of being broadcasting worldwide and becoming the spotlight. Media coverage before and during the games is undeniable and this fact leads to an exposure that will bring more visitors. For example, Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games held in Brazil had increased 40% touristâ\\x80\\x99s visits through 2 years after the Games. Therefore, hosting international events can be remarkable to  economic growth through the tourism industry. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, hosting the Olympic Games can be catastrophic if not well planned. It is crucial to plan a long term and map out all the sports venues on how they can be used after the games, otherwise, several venues can become white-elephants stadiums.  To illustrate this, the Athenaâ\\x80\\x99s Olympics Games in 2004 was an outstanding event, notwithstanding, it was not well organized and most of the arenas nowadays are destroyed due to time. Thus, a plethora of money can be spent when a country receives the bid of a Games and the return of investment can be pointless if not well-planned. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo conclude, from the arguments presented above, it is inconceivable to believe that financial expenditure does not exist. Nevertheless, there is positive effects as well as drawbacks when hosting any mega event.', \"Most world-class museums are free in London, but some museums and art galleries around the world have an admission charges. Frankly speaking, museums with free entry do not mean no cost incurred in their operation. In contrary, there is a lot of maintenance expenditure on exhibits of museums, particularly on historical paintings and valuable statues. These costs are funded by the governments in order to provide the welfare to their civilians. Some people advocate all museums and art galleries should charge the entrance fees as the public funding have to be spent in dire need of foods and housing in the community. This essay attempts to find out its benefits against costs.\\nThere is no doubt that thousand millions expenditure in the operating of museums are financed by the local governments. The UK government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds a year on supporting the cultural and artistic life of the country. Some people object to this expenditure, arguing that it is unfair to devote much tax payers' money to things which only appeal to a minority of people. They think these attractions should be self-funding, in other words, museums and galleries should set an entrance fee which cover their costs, besides, these costs are reflected via a realistic amount for tickets. The public funds saved could then be spent on more important matters such as housing or providing better educational facilities.\\nNevertheless, the culture and arts are not a trivial matter but a vital part of a nation's identity. Not only the arts have a key educational role by representing the traditions and heritage of people, but also galleries and museums should be freely available to all, rich or poor. It is clear that this is basic welfare to all citizens in a country. From economic aspects, tourism can be drived by these attractions. A case in point is British museum, which appeals an endless influx of tourists from various parts of the world to visit every year. Therefore, they are responsible for a significant amount of employment.\\nMy take on this is that the governments have a responsibility to support a range of cultural and artistic activities and to make the museums and galleries free available to all their civilians despite many demanding on their funding resources in the community.\", 'Robots have been around us for many years performing many repetitive tasks and the recent developments in this area of technology allow them to do more complex tasks. The proponents of this technology believe robots would play an important role in our future endeavours, while others believe it may have some adverse impact on society. I agree with the former view and this essay will discuss both views with more emphasis on the former. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most important use of robots is that they could perform highly risky tasks such as bomb disposal and firefighting. They are more agile and can withstand extreme conditions that are impossible for humans to bear. In addition, they can work round the clock without complaining or restrictions. Teller machines and robots used in manufacturing industries are good examples of such continuous work. With the developments of artificial intelligence, every piece of equipment is embedded with a certain amount of intelligence making them more versatile and useful. \\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents of robotics raise two key issues against their wide use. Firstly, they express their concerns over the employment problem as robots would take over many jobs currently performed by humans. One such area of great concern is driverless cars which would deprive millions of drivers worldwide of their livelihood. Added to this problem will be the issue of computer viruses or going the control of robots into the wrong hands. This kind of malfunctioning or disruptive act would undoubtedly have disastrous results. However, restructuring businesses to offer more job opportunities to people in a technological era and a protective mechanism for the control of robots would mitigate such mishaps. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, robots have useful as well as potentially harmful effects on society. However, restructuring the entire society to suit this technology era would allow us to yield the best use of them.', 'Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all childrenÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someoneÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talentsÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99 development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.', 'Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.', \"Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.\\nThis kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.\\nI believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.\\nFor instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.\\nIn other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.\\nI bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.\", 'As the technology is improving, more people are seeing to become reliable to the computers\\nWhat things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?\\nComputers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.\\nIn the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.\\nThere is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers..', 'It is unequivocal that people hold different views about the means of getting the news. Although some people maintain that newspapers are the best way to learn news, I hold a belief that  people can learn news better through other types of media since these methods are easily accessible and more economical compared to the conventional newspaper. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, there are some rationales why people believe that newspapers are the best way to learn the news. Chief among these is that reading newspaper has high levels of accuracy because it is strictly censored by the state. One of the most appealing illustrations is  Thanh Nien newspapers which provides a host of thoughtful topics so many people enjoy reading this newpaper. Added to this, when you learn news by newspapers, you can practice concentration skills, while other types of media can make them distracted, they are not focused on the topics. Moreover, this can make us practice more reading skills, some people are not good at technology so it is hard for them to choose suitable sites to read news.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the above-mentioned justifications, I still gravitate towards the view that people can learn news better through other media. one of the most compelling reasons is that, when we learn new through other types of media, it will be more diverse in topics. it bears witness to foreign news, we can get high-accuracy information, these are easily accessible and more economical compared to conventional newspapers. to add further credence to my assertion. all types of media are  free, we can be read easily with the click of a button. it brings convenience for people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, although there is no doubt that reading newspapers is still a ubiquitous type of getting informed, reading news types of other media is the best way to learn news in the modern times'], 'chosen': ['## Task Achievement:\\n- The candidate has adequately addressed the task by discussing both the potential disadvantages and benefits of attending single-sex schools compared to co-educational schools.\\n- The response is somewhat clear and coherent, but some ideas lack depth and development.\\n- The essay covers most aspects of the task but lacks specific examples or research to support the arguments.\\n- Suggested Band Score (Task Achievement): 6.0\\n\\n## Coherence and Cohesion:\\n- The organization of the essay is generally logical, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.\\n- However, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother, and the essay lacks a clear topic sentence for each body paragraph.\\n- Linking devices are used occasionally but could be employed more consistently to enhance cohesion.\\n- Suggested Band Score (Coherence and Cohesion): 6.0\\n\\n## Lexical Resource (Vocabulary):\\n- The range of vocabulary is limited, with some repetition of words and phrases.\\n- There are some inaccuracies in vocabulary, such as \"demerits\" instead of \"disadvantages.\"\\n- The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the context but could be more varied and sophisticated.\\n- Suggested Band Score (Lexical Resource): 5.5\\n\\n## Grammatical Range and Accuracy:\\n- The sentence structures are relatively simple, with a mix of short and long sentences.\\n- There are several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb forms (\"consantration\" instead of \"concentration\") and sentence construction (\"It will increase some oppotunities\" instead of \"It will increase opportunities\").\\n- Punctuation is used inconsistently, and some sentences lack clarity due to grammatical errors.\\n- Suggested Band Score (Grammatical Range and Accuracy): 5.5\\n\\n## Overall Band Score:\\n- The essay meets the requirements of the task and demonstrates some coherence and cohesion, but it lacks depth of discussion, accuracy, and sophistication in language use.\\n- The overall performance across all criteria aligns with a band score of **6.0**.\\n\\n## Feedback and Additional Comments:\\n- Strengths:\\n    -

      "\"Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only. Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty. But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again. Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there. Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.\"\n",

      "\"International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country. On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone. On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes. To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone.\"\n",

      "\"These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships. First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded. In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well. In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.\"\n",

      "{'prompt': 'Young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?', 'essay': 'Deciding to choose among the potential ways of punishing young people who commit crimes continues to be a controversial issue for the societies and the governments. It is argued by some that these people should be treated the same as adults. I personally disagree with this opinion due to the adverse effects of imprisonment on a teenager’s mental health.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany countries put the criminals of their society at jails considering it as a very effective way of punishment. It is understandable that this does exert a positive influence on decreasing crime in the society by putting the criminals in an unpleasant situation which they would mostly never wish to experience again. As a result, this could impede them from attempting crime in the future. For example, my friend who had been sent to jail for 2 months because of repeatedly committing traffic offends, has never committed the same crime since being released admitting that being in prison had been intolerable for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I believe using the same way of punishment for youngsters would not be a wise idea. In fact, teenagers are at a very critical age in which the core of their personality is being shaped. There for, sending them to prison like adults as a way of punishment for their crimes, which are most often pity crimes, would actually expose them to other criminals who might have some serious personality disorders and this would adversely affect their personality as an adult in the future. To put in another way, such punishments are potential to become a threat to their mental health leading them to commit more serious crimes in a long run. For instance, according to the law of my country, young people are being punished the same as adults. A recent survey revealed that this policy has not been effective so far since 60% of these teenage criminals end up drug trafficking after being released from prison which had been sent to for a pity crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, although the ways that adults are being punished in many countries might be quite effective to decrease crime rate, I do not agree that it is a wise decision to use these ways for punishing young people as well.', 'evaluation': '## Task Achievement:\\nThe candidate has adequately addressed the task by presenting a clear stance on the topic and providing relevant arguments. The essay covers all parts of the task by discussing both sides of the argument and providing examples to support their reasoning. The ideas are presented in a coherent and logical manner.\\n\\nSuggested Band Score (Task Achievement): 7\\n\\n## Coherence and Cohesion:\\nThe essay is well-organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. The paragraphs flow smoothly from one to another, and linking devices are used effectively to connect ideas and ensure a logical flow of information. The essay is easy to follow and understand.\\n\\nSuggested Band Score (Coherence and Cohesion): 7\\n\\n## Lexical Resource (Vocabulary):\\n- **Mistake**: \"there for\"\\n  - **Rectified**: therefore\\n- **Mistake**: \"pity crimes\"\\n  - **Rectified**: minor offenses\\n\\nThe candidate demonstrates a good range of vocabulary, using a variety of words and phrases to express their ideas. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies and overused words, such as \"imprisonment\" and \"adverse effects,\" which could be replaced with more precise or varied vocabulary.\\n\\nSuggested Band Score (Lexical Resource): 6.5\\n\\n## Grammatical Range and Accuracy:\\n- **Mistake**: \"It is understandable that this does exert a positive influence on decreasing crime in the society by putting the criminals in an unpleasant situation which they would mostly never wish to experience again\"\\n  - **Rectified**: It is understandable that this exerts a positive influence on decreasing crime in society by putting criminals in an unpleasant situation that they would mostly never wish to experience again.\\n- **Mistake**: \"For there, sending them to prison like adults as a way of punishment for their crimes, which are most often pity crimes, would actually expose them to other criminals who might have some serious personality disorders and this would adversely affect their personality as an adult in the future\"\\n  - **Rectified**: However, sending them to prison like adults as a way of punishment for their crimes, which are most often pity crimes, would expose them to other criminals who might have serious personality disorders, and this would adversely affect their personality as adults in the future.\\n\\nThe essay demonstrates a good range of sentence structures but could benefit from more variety and complexity. There are also a few grammatical errors, particularly in the use of prepositions and sentence construction, which could be corrected for greater accuracy.\\n\\nSuggested Band Score (Grammatical Range and Accuracy): 6.5\\n\\n## Overall Band Score:\\n\\nConsidering the essay\\'s overall performance across all criteria, a suggested overall band score would be 6.5. The essay addresses the task effectively, is well-organized, and demonstrates a good range of vocabulary and grammar. However, some minor inaccuracies and grammatical errors could be improved for greater precision and clarity.\\n\\n## Feedback and Additional Comments:\\n\\n Strengths:\\n- The essay is well-organized and easy to follow.\\n- The arguments are supported with relevant examples.\\n- The candidate demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.\\n\\nAreas for Improvement:\\n- Expand the vocabulary by using more precise and varied words and phrases.\\n- Edit for grammatical errors to enhance accuracy and clarity.\\n- Consider using more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a wider range of grammatical ability.\\n\\nAdditional Suggestions:\\n- To enhance vocabulary, the candidate could read more widely and expose themselves to a variety of texts.\\n- To improve grammatical accuracy, the candidate could practice writing regularly and seek feedback from a teacher or language partner.', 'band': '5\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r'}\n"

      "Enter the essay text: \"In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications. The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers. Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy. To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.\"\n",

It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand.
